8. Remove seeds from peeled tomatoes, while tearing tomatoes into 1/2" sized chunks. (Don't obsess over size as tomatoes will be blended into smaller chunks later in the process.)

9. After all peeled tomatoes have had seeds removed and chunked down, place tomatoes back into empty large red pot. Read the number of cups of tomatoes from the inside markings of the pot and convert to ounces. (E.g., 15 cups converts to 120 ounces.) Use this number to appropriately scale the following recipe, which is based on 56 ounces of tomatoes (E.g., 120 ounces scales to roughly double the amount of each ingredient called for in the original recipe.):

   1. Place sauce pan on stove on medium-high heat.
   
   |     Ingredients     |  Quantity  |
   |---------------------|------------|
   | butter, cubed       | 3 1/2 TBsp | 
   | white onion, grated | 2/3 cup    |
   | garlic, minced      | 5 tsp      |

   2. Dump above ingredients into sauce pan and combine for 5 minutes.
   
   |      Ingredients      |  Quantity  |
   |-----------------------|------------|
   | crushed tomatoes      | 28 oz. can | 
   | whole peeled tomatoes | 28 oz. can |
   | tomato paste          | 3   oz can |

   3. Dump above ingredients into bowl and use spoon to work tomato paste in.

   |      Ingredients      |  Quantity  |
   |-----------------------|------------|
   | salt                  | 1.75 tsp   | 
   | sugar                 | 1.66 TBsp  |
   | dried oregano         | 1 tsp      |
   | dried basil           | 1 tsp      |
   | red pepper flakes     | 1 tsp      |

   4. Dump above ingredients into tomato bowl mixture and stir.

   5. Add sauce pan mixture to tomato bowl mixture, turn heat to medium, and cook for 45 minutes.

   6. Use hand blender to reduce size of tomato chunks to desired spaghetti sauce consistency, keeping in mind you don't want it to be totally runny.

10. Remove from heat and let it cool. By nightfall, place in refrigerator for bagging next morning.

11. Use funnel to ladle sauce into quart-sized freezer ziplock bags. 

12. Weigh and label bags, then place in freezer.
