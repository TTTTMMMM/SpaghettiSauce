2. 1rst person: use a paring knife blade to de-stem and cut X-pattern onto bottom of each tomato.

3. 2nd person: boil water in large red pot.
4. 2nd person: make ice-water bath using large blue bowl.
5. As 1rst person de-stems, 2nd person should place tomatoes in boiling water for approximately 30 seconds, until skin starts to peel.

8. Remove seeds from peeled tomatoes, while tearing tomatoes into 1/2" sized chunks. (Don't obsess over size as tomatoes will be blended into smaller chunks later in the process.)

9. After all peeled tomatoes have had seeds removed and chunked down, place tomatoes back into empty large red pot. Read the number of cups of tomatoes from the inside markings of the pot and convert to ounces. (E.g., 15 cups converts to 120 ounces.) Used this number to appropriately scale the following recipe, which is based on 56 ounces of tomatoes (E.g., 120 ounces scales to roughly double the amount of each ingredient called for in the original recipe.):
